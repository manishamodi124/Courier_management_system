## Authentication

JWT is used for login and role-based access. Passwords are protected using **bcryptjs**.

### Admin and Staff Setup

Admin and Staff accounts can be created or updated from the backend using the available setup scripts.

```bash
node createAdmin.js
node createStaff.js
```

These scripts connect to MongoDB and create or update the accounts.


---

## PDF Generation

The project uses **PDFKit** for generating courier-related PDF documents.

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR-GITHUB-REPOSITORY-URL>
```

```bash
cd courier-management-system
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

Open the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder.

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If Nodemon is not configured, you can use:

```bash
node server.js
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory.

| Variable     | Description                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`       | Backend server port                    |
| `MONGO_URI`  | MongoDB database connection URL        |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key used for JWT authentication |

> ⚠️ Never upload your `.env` file or database credentials to GitHub.
